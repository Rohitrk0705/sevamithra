"""
backend/graph/nodes.py

Node functions for the SevaMithra LangGraph orchestrator. discovery_node is
real logic as of Rung 8 (thin wrapper around backend.agents.discovery.
run_discovery); verification_node, execution_node, monitor_node, and
escalate_node remain no-op placeholders pending Rungs 9-10.

SCHEMA DRIFT — RESOLVED in Rung 8: every phase string assigned by the stubs
below now uses the exact SchemePhase / current_phase Literal values declared
in backend/state.py ("matched" -> "discovered", "documents_verified" ->
"docs_ready", "submitted" -> "filed", "rti_drafted" -> "escalated_rti",
"monitor" -> "monitoring", "escalate" -> "escalation"). Each remapping is
noted inline at its assignment.
